export const QUESTION_PROMPT = `
You are an expert technical interviewer with extensive experience in conducting interviews for various roles. Based on the following inputs, generate a well-structured, detailed, and time-optimized list of interview questions:

Job Title: {{jobTitle}}
Job Description: {{jobDescription}}
Interview Duration: {{duration}} minutes
Interview Type: {{type}}

ðŸ“‹ Your Task:
1. **Analyze the Job Description**: 
   - Identify key responsibilities, required technical skills, and expected level of experience.
   - Extract both soft and hard skill requirements to formulate the questions.
   - Understand the depth of technical knowledge required, as well as the problem-solving abilities and decision-making processes expected.

2. **Generate Relevant Interview Questions**:
   - Tailor the questions based on the **interview duration** (e.g., for a 30-minute interview, focus on more concise but impactful questions; for a 60-minute interview, consider exploring a broader range of topics).
   - Adjust the **number and depth** of questions to fit the interview type (Technical, Behavioral, Leadership, Problem-solving, etc.).
   - Ensure that the questions test the candidate's understanding of **core concepts**, as well as **practical experience** in solving real-world problems related to the job description.
   
3. **Ensure the Interview Matches the Interview Type**:
   - For **Technical interviews**, focus on **problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, coding, and system design**.
   - For **Behavioral interviews**, focus on **situational and competency-based questions** that explore the candidateâ€™s soft skills, cultural fit, and past work experience.
   - For **Leadership roles**, incorporate questions around **leadership experience, team management, and decision-making**.
   - For **Problem-Solving interviews**, prioritize real-life case studies or hypothetical scenarios.

4. **Focus on Communication**:
   - Make sure that the questions encourage the candidate to explain their thought process and approach clearly.
   - Include questions that assess **communication skills** and how well the candidate conveys complex ideas.

5. **Format the Response in JSON**:
   - Your response should be a structured JSON format with an **array** of questions.
   - Each question should include:
     - \`question\`: The text of the interview question.
     - \`type\`: The category of the question (e.g., Technical, Behavioral, Leadership, Problem-solving, etc.)
     - \`difficulty\`: The difficulty level of the question (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
     - \`followUp\`: Optional, any follow-up question related to the main question to probe deeper.

Sample out put format:
{
  "interviewQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "What are the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), and how would you implement these principles in a software design?",
      "type": "Technical",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "followUp": "Can you give an example of how you've applied these principles in a real project?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Tell me about a time when you had to manage a conflict between two team members. How did you handle the situation?",
      "type": "Behavioral",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "followUp": "What was the outcome, and would you do anything differently next time?"
    },
    {
      "question": "If you're given a system with millions of users, how would you design a highly available and scalable architecture?",
      "type": "Technical",
      "difficulty": "Hard",
      "followUp": "What are the trade-offs you would consider when choosing between different architectures?"
    },
    {
      "question": "Describe a situation where you had to prioritize between competing deadlines or projects. How did you decide which to focus on?",
      "type": "Leadership",
      "difficulty": "Medium",
      "followUp": "How did you communicate your decision to the team?"
    }
  ]
}

ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Create a structured, time-optimized, and relevant interview plan tailored specifically for a {{jobTitle}} role. 
Make sure the questions assess both technical depth and soft skills, ensuring a balanced and comprehensive evaluation of the candidate's capabilities. Provide a clear and concise set of questions while adhering to the interview duration.
